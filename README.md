This is a simple dashboard to display information about connected servers such as load average, temperature, ram usage, disk usage, and more. The dashboard is written in VueJS3 with the backend written in Rust. The backend has no authentication and is intended to be used over lan, however, authentication is trivial to add. It's technically a HTTP/REST API.

too lazy to write more of the readme, maybe later on :)
